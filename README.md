# Dashboard-using-react
Developed a basic data visualisation dashboard using ReactJS

Dataset used is from a Praan device installed in the real world.
Here’s the description of the fields
device: device id
t: Timestamp
w: windspeed in km/h
h: wind-direction
p1: PM 1.0 particle
p25: PM 2.5 particle
p10: PM 10 particle

Visualisations
1. Charts to compare the 3 locations’ data throughout the day. Compare the pm1, pm2.5, 
and pm10 values separately.
2. Add a way to filter the data according to a time-range.
3. Plot a time-series graph with the pm readings overlaid on top of each other
